= Lab Excerise: The Problem!

In this lab exercise, you deploy the Parasol Insurance application using Quarkus and test the chatbot by asking, "How much does it cost to repair a flux capacitor in a DeLorean?" You'll notice that the chatbot gives a humorous, off-base answer, showing it doesn't know about this fictional repair.

[NOTE]
====
In this lab, you will be working with three terminals, each serving a distinct purpose:

* First Terminal: Keep an eye on GPU performance throughout the lab. This terminal will provide real-time monitoring to ensure everything is running smoothly.
* Second Terminal: Use this terminal to manage the Quakarus application, which will host the Parasol Insurance Application. It's your gateway to running and maintaining the application effectively.
* Third Terminal: This terminal is dedicated to InstructLab. Here, you'll train the Merlinite model specifically for the Parasol Insurance Application, setting up the environment and executing the necessary commands for model training.
====

. Monitor the GPU:
* Open the first terminal and execute the nvtop (NVIDIA TOP) command to immerse yourself in real-time GPU insights. This will allow you to keep a close watch on GPU utilization throughout the lab, ensuring you have a comprehensive understanding of your GPU's performance.

. Set up your lab environment for the Parasol Insurance application and InstructLab:
* Open the second terminal and begin by creating the `~/install.sh` script using `vi` or any other editor of your choice to set up your lab environment.

* Tap on the chatbot logo nestled in the bottom right corner of the claims page. Pose the intriguing question, "How much does it cost to repair a flux capacitor in a DeLorean?" and watch as the chatbot gives a response that clearly shows it's not familiar with this quirky detail.
+

* Try asking again, and you'll notice that the answer remains just as playful and elusive.

* Head to the next section where you'll tackle this challenge by training the chatbot. Using InstructLab, you'll guide the Merlinite model through its paces, equipping it with the knowledge needed to provide more accurate answers. Let's dive into the process and transform our chatbot's responses together!
