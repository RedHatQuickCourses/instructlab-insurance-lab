= Lab Excerise: The Solution!

In this lab, you'll continue the journey with InstructLab to train the Merlinite model. Your mission is to refine its responses so it can deliver a more accurate answer to the question, "How much does it cost to repair a flux capacitor in a DeLorean?" Let's bring a touch of clarity to our chatbot's whimsical responses!

[NOTE]
====
In this lab, you'll keep the three terminals that served as your companions in the previous section when you were reproducing the problem. Each terminal will continue to play its crucial role as you move forward in the exercise.
====

. Monitor the GPU:
* Keep the first terminal open, running the nvtop command, to dive back into real-time GPU insights, just as you did in the previous lab. This terminal will continue to be your window into the dynamic world of GPU performance.

[instruct@instructlab ~]$ **nvtop**

. Training the Merlinite model using InstructLab:

* Within this lab, you'll find some data located at **~/files/qna.yaml** that contains the necessary details to answer questions such as "How much does it cost to repair a flux capacitor in a DeLorean?" for the Parasol Insurance application.

* Switch to the third terminal, stop the `ilab serve` command, review the data at **~/files/qna.yaml** , and familiarize yourself with its contents.
+

----
(venv) [instruct@instructlab instructlab]$ cat ~/files/qna.yaml
----

* Create the below folder to hold the data related to the Parasol Insurance application.
+
[subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
(venv) [instruct@instructlab instructlab]$ mkdir -p ~/instructlab/taxonomy/knowledge/parasol/overview
----

* Copy the **~/files/qna.yaml** to this newly created location.
+
[subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
(venv) [instruct@instructlab instructlab]$ cp ~/files/qna.yaml ~/instructlab/taxonomy/knowledge/parasol/overview/qna.yaml
----

* Let's compare the current state of taxonomy against the newly copied **qna.yaml**.
+
[subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
(venv) [instruct@instructlab instructlab]$ ilab taxonomy diff
knowledge/parasol/overview/qna.yaml
Taxonomy in taxonomy is valid :)
----

* Next, let's create synthetic training data. This command will generate 200 new instructions based on the provided taxonomy and model configuration. By generating this data, you enhance the model's ability to understand and respond accurately to various queries. This synthetic data is crucial for improving the model's performance and ensuring it can handle a wide range of questions related to the Parasol Insurance application. This step will take around approximately 75 minutes to complete! The command will also require significant computational resources, including GPU power.

----
(venv) [instruct@instructlab instructlab]$ ilab data generate --num-instructions 200
----

* Let's train the Merlinite model to better understand and respond to queries, improving its performance and accuracy in real-world applications. The **--iters 300** below specifies that the model should undergo 300 training iterations. The **--device cuda** option tells the training process to utilize the GPU (CUDA-enabled device) for enhanced computational performance.

* To put the model's training to the ultimate test, we'll start by asking a specific question: **How much does it cost to repair a flux capacitor in a DeLorean?** The expected answer is $10,000,000. This test will reveal if the model has absorbed the training effectively and is capable of providing accurate and reliable responses.
